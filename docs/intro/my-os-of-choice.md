# What OS to install for a homelab?

I currently use TrueNAS as my main OS for my homelab. It was an easy way to dip my toes into the homelab world and kubernetes. I am aware of things like Rancher which has fewer restrictions than TrueNAS, but I am happy with TrueNAS for now. This is as I want to use the Truecharts repository for my helm charts.

Truecharts is doing some further work into helm and rancher that I will look at in the future in a VM/Proxmox setup to get around restrictions in TrueNAS.
