# What OS to install for a homelab?

I currently use TrueNAS as my main OS for my homelab. It was an easy way to dip my toes into the homelab world and kubernetes. I am aware of things like Rancher which has fewer restrictions than TrueNAS, but I am happy with TrueNAS for now. This as I want to use the Truecharts repository for my helm charts.

There are likely better choices especially if you want to run apps exclusively but TrueNAS keeps everything consolidated and easy to manage.
