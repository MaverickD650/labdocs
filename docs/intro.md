# Docs Intro

Pure and simple I started this site to document my setup, tempt employers and try a cool method of deploying a site. Currently I use Github pages to host the site and Github actions to build and deploy the site. I use [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) to build the site and currently edit it with [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Github actions is used to build the site and deploy it to the gh-pages branch. I have a custom domain setup to point to the gh-pages branch. The site automatically builds and deploys when I push to the main branch.

I would like to try a more slick solution to editing the site, but I am not sure what that would be. I am open to suggestions.
