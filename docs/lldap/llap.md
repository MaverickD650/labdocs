# LLDAP TrueCharts Notes

## Default Configuration

LLDAP is configured using the default options generated by the application on first run. The exception to this is the 'Base DN for LDAP' option which has been exposed to the user. The JWT token has been set to auto-generate on first run and is stored in the background as this is not anticipated to be changed by the user or needed in day to day use. I intended to keep the chart as simple as possible and not expose options that are not needed.

By default, LLDAP will use the following options:

- Admin username: admin
- Admin password: password
- Base DN for LDAP: dc=example,dc=org
- LDAP port: 3890

> ⚠️ **WARNING**: The default configuration is not secure and should not be used in production. Please change the admin password for LDAP before using LLDAP in production. ⚠️

## Usage

LLDAP can be used as the user backend for Authelia and Authentik as well as any other application that supports LDAP e.g. Jellyfin and Nextcloud.
